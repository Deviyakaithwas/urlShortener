This assignment aims to assess your backend development skills using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. I have built a RESTful API crafting a URL shortener service – a tool that transforms lengthy URLs into bite-sized versions. This service should be equipped with the following functionalities: 
Functionalities: 
● Users can submit a lengthy URL through a POST request to /shorten it. 
● The API will generate a unique short URL for the submitted original URL and store it in the database. 
● The response should include both the original and shortened URLs. 
● Users can access the original URL by visiting the generated short URL. 
● Implement basic user registration and login functionalities for secure access. 

Backend: 
○ Node.js (version LTS) 
○ Express.js 
○ Mongoose 
Database: MongoDB
